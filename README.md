# SecretSanta
This way there is absolute secrecy and no administrator ("Did you draw your own name from the bucket?")

I was once challenged to do this and I could not find an easy and simple version of it - so here it is

# What it does
- taking a string of all the participants ramdomly assignes everyone a different person. The program outputs a textfile for each person where they can find who they are buying for. 

# Don't get me wrong can and will be improved:
- Improve the functionality - be able to take commas after names
- Would make the program take in the names by a seperate text file or commandline
- See if it can be emailed to the personals account
